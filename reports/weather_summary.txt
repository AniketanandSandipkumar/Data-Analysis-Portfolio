EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

This retail sales analysis examines transaction-level data to understand overall revenue performance and purchasing patterns. The goal is to provide insights that help improve sales strategy, inventory planning, and customer value optimization.

The dataset reveals total sales of 519,280.69, with an average transaction value of 259.64. These figures indicate a steady revenue flow driven by moderate spending per purchase rather than a few extremely high-value transactions.

A consistent average transaction size suggests stable customer buying behavior, which is beneficial for forecasting and stock management. However, it also highlights an opportunity to increase revenue through upselling, cross-selling, or bundled promotions to raise the average basket value.

Key Implication:
The business shows stable but optimizable sales performance. Strategic promotions, product bundling, and targeted marketing can help increase average transaction value and overall revenue without needing a proportional increase in customer volume.
